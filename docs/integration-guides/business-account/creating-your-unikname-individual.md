## Coupon

You can create @unikname with a minium of 15 characters for free.

If you want to create special @unikname with less than 15 charaters, it requires a coupon. and if you have one, you can continue. 

Otherwise, contact us on [contact@unikname.com](mailto:contact@unikname.com) to request one.

## Subscribing to the Unikname newsletter

As a decentralized application, we will never link the e-mail address you enter to subscribe to the newsletter to your @unikname identifier. 

We store your e-mail address on a specific Unikname server. We use this server only to store our customers e-mail addresses. 
Different from a Saas (Software as a Service)...

What is your newsletter client? Mailtrain
Why do you use Mailtrain? We use mail train because it is a self-hosted app. We store it on our own secured and private server.

## Create your @unikname

On the next screen, choose the option that corresponds to your situation depending on whether you have a coupon ("I GOT A COUPON") or not ("GET A FREE @UNIKNAME").

#### **Why do you need to backup your passphrase immediately?**
Your passphrase enables you to retrieve your @unikname anytime, in case you change/lose your device. 

Privacy and confidentiality are very important for us. This is wy neither <uns/> nor Unikname can retrieve/restore or reset your @unikname or passphrase.

Now you have an individual @unikname, let's create your organization @unikname.
