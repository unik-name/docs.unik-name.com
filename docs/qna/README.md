# Q&A Unikname

[[TOC]]

### Why do I have to pay for a Unikname shorter than 15 characters?

It is easy to counterfeit or to create two similar identifiers, especially if they are short. (exemaple: @cecile and @cec1le).
To prevent this issue, we created the Safetypo technology (see [Key Concepts > Safetypo](safetypo). 
The Safetypo technology is an algorithm that prevents the creation of similar, confusing or counterfeited identifiers. 

On the contrary, it is difficult to squat/counterfeit/create unvolontary similar and long identifiers (15 characters or more). That is why long uniknames are free. A protection against squatting: uneasy to squat a 15-characters identifier. Moreover, long @unikname idenfiers are also everlasting. 

### What is Safetypo?
See [Key Concepts > Safetypo](safetypo).

### Are free @uniknames based on Safetypo too?
?

### How can I retrieve my @unikname/passphrase? 
Your @unikname and passphrase are confidential data. We do not keep any information about these data. We  During the Unikname app installation, you have been asked to save your passphrase on your device or in any secure place at your convenience. 
If you can't retrieve your passphrase, consider your @unikname lost.


### What can I do if I have lost my @uniknmae/passphrase?
Unless you have saved your passphrase in a secure place, we cannot retrieve it for you. 
Personal, confidential @unikname/passphrase

### Where do you store my PIN code and Unikname identifier?
We don't store your data anywhere. 
We don't have any permission/rights over your credentials (PIN code, @unikname identifiers). 
@unikname identifiers are based on the "self-sovereign identity principle. This means you the only person able to control your credentials.
