## Step 1. Configure your Auth0 service

Once your Auth0 application has been created, you can add an `Enterprise Connection`. Use `Open Id Connect` link.

Fill-in the following required fields to setup <brand name="UNC"/>: 

| Attribut | Value / Description |
|--------|-----------|
| `Connection name` | It's an internal name (Ex: `unikname-connect`) |
| `Display name` | Enter `your private @unikname`.<br/>It will display `Continue with your private @unikname` on the connection button |
| `Logo url` | Add this url `https://cdn.unikname.com/logos/20/un-blue-nbt.png` to display the Unikname icon on the button ![Unikname logo](https://cdn.unikname.com/logos/20/un-blue-nbt.png) |
| `Issuer URL` | <UncServerUrl/> |
| `Client ID` | The client ID you have received from Unikname's support request |
| `Client Secret` | The client secret you have received from Unikname's support request |

## Step 2. Enable your `Open ID Connect` Connection for your Auth0 application

Go to your application connections list and enable the `unikname-connect` `Open ID Connect` connection.

## Step 3. Test Unikname Connect on your website

Go to your website and click on the `sign-up` button. You should see a signup screen like this one:

Finally enter your personal @unikname and validate the authentication on your smartphone. You're automatically redirected to the signup process on your forum.

**All done!**

New users are now able to use their @unikname SSID to sign-up to your website.

## Troubleshooting

If youâ€™re having issues when connecting (access denied ...), check that the credentials (the @unikname of your organization, Unikname Connect secret, client id/secret ...) you are using to connect to <brand name="UNC"/> authentication server are the good one.
