## Unikname Connect - What is Unikname Connect?

Unikname Connect is a simple, secure and privacy-by-design login solution. 

**A simple-login solution**

Unikname Connect allows you to log in to websites simply with your @unikname. No password is required.

Unikname Connect allows you to connect to websites through the Unikname application that you install on your smartphone.
When you want to connect a a website, on your computer, you:
click the UNikname button on the website
you enter your @unikname on the Unikname application installed on your smartphone. 
That's it. You are logged in.

**Privacy-by-design**
Privacy comes first. Our application is entirely built with the idea to keep your personal data private. We don't collect these personal data (name, phone number, address, history) at any moment as well as we will never use your @unikname to trace your habits and behaviors on the Web.  

**A secure solution**
Based on a blochain technology, Unikname Connect is fully decentralized. 

When you use the Unikname application for the first time, you are asked to define: 
- a PIN code, to unlock your @unikname, on your device.  
- a @unikname, which is a universal identifier that cannot be counterfeited. 
- a secret recovery key, in the event that you lose your @unikname or personal device. 

These data are not stored on any database. That means that nobody can rob them.

**anti-phishing**
It a natural anti-phishing solution as you don't create any password and as we don't store any of your personal data in any database.

**No counterfeiting**
It is impossible to create two similar @uniknames. Unikname Connect uses an algorithm, called Safetypo, that prevents the creation of similar @uniknames.
Example :
once @cecile has been created, it is impossible to create @cecilee or @cec1le, and so on. 

**anti-spoofing**
It is a natural anti-spoofing solution because your @unikname is not linked to your e-mail address in any way.
