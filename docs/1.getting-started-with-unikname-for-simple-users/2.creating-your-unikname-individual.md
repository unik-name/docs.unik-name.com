### Creating a short @unikname, with a coupon 
If you have a coupon, you can create a "short" @unikname, of 8-characters, or more. 
Short @uniknames are protected by our Safetypo algorithm. It prevents other users to create identical or fraudulent @uniknames.

### Creating a free @unikname
You can create a @unikname for free, only if it is longer than 15 characters. 

If you wish to create a shorter @unikname, contact us on [contact@unikname.com](mailto:contact@unikname.com).

## 4. Backup your recovery key
Your @unikname and all associated data (PIN code, recovery key) are strictly personal and confidential. We can't help you retrieve or restore it if you lose them or change your device. This is why **you must backup your recovery key immediately**.
