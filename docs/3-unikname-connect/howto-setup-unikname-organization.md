# How to setup your Organization @unikname?

Your users must be able to check and verify information about your service, especially your business name and its web address. Let's configure your organization @unikname identifier. It will reveal, to the uns.network [UNS.network](https://explorer.uns.network) community, your business name and associated data.

[[toc]]

## 1. Disclose your organization @unikname identifier

By default, all @unikname values are obfuscated and hidden for all. The action of revealing your @unikname identifier data to [UNS.network](https://explorer.uns.network) community is called "disclose your @unikname identifier".

1. Open the [UNS CLI](creating-unikname-organization). 
2. Run the following command line to disclose and verify the @unikname value:

```bash
    $ uns unik:disclose "@organization:mycompany"  -e "My-Company"
```

2. Replace the value `mycompany` by the organization @unikname identifier you want to disclose, internally in [UNS.network](https://explorer.uns.network).
3. Replace `My-Company` by the "official/public" value you want to show to your users for your organization @unikname identifier.<br/>

:::tip
Refer to the [@unikname naming schema](soon) to ensure that you entered the @unikname value properly.::: 

## 2. Verify the web address of your service

You must also reveal to your users the web address (domain URL) of your service and that it has been verified.
