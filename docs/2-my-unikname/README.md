# Introduction to @Unikname Universal ID

**@unikname is a Universal IDentifier.** It's Human-Readable and Self-Sovereign**, that means it's easy to memorize it, it's always available, it's usable everywhere, and maybe the most important, it's under the sole control of its owner.

To get your own @unikname identifier you just have to install the ``My Unikname App`` and to follow a 3 steps process. Once you own your @unikname, you can sign-up and log in to any website that embeds the Unikname Connect widget/pluggin, and start being rewarded.

**My.Unikname.App allows to @unikname owner to control their digital life.** @unikname owners can get and manage their @unikname and can also control everything they can do with their ID, like private sign-up and login to websites.
