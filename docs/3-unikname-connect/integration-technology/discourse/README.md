<br/>

<brand name="UNC"/> can be easily integrated with Discourse with a simple plugin. 

<brand name="UNC"/> has been designed to work with open-source solutions compatible with the OAuth/OpenID Connect authorization standard protocol. The famous open-source [Discourse forum solution](https://www.discourse.org), respectful of user privacy, is one of them. 

:::tip Example
Our discussion Forum website has been built with Discourse. 

ðŸ‘‰ You're welcome to [sign-up on our forum](https://forum.unikname.com/) with your own @unikname.
:::

To make integration very easy we've developed a specific ready-to-use plugin. Here under you will see how to install and setup this Discourse plugin.

:book: We assume you're familiar with the Discourse installation process.
:::

## Step 1. Install Discourse plugin

Connect to your Discourse server, and access your containerâ€™s `app.yml` file. It should be present in `/var/discourse/containers/`)

:::tip Information
you can't install a plugin from the admin panel ðŸ˜ž
:::

Enter the following command to edit your yml config file:
```bash
cd /var/discourse
nano containers/app.yml
````

Add the Discourse Unikname Connect pluginâ€™s repository URL to your containerâ€™s `app.yml` file:

```
hooks:
  after_code:
    - exec:
        cd: $home/plugins
        cmd:
          - ...
          - sudo -E -u discourse git clone https://github.com/unik-name/discourse-unikname-connect-authentication-plugin
```

> Add the pluginâ€™s `git clone` url just below `sudo -E -u discourse git clone https://github.com/discourse/docker_manager.git`)

Rebuild the container:
```bash
cd /var/discourse
./launcher rebuild app
```

Thatâ€™s it! Youâ€™ve successfully installed the Unikname Connect plugin on your Discourse instance!

## Step 2. Setup Discourse plugging

As an admin, go to the Discourse "burger" menu â†’ admin â†’ "Settings" tab â†’ "Plugin" category.

You can also go to `https://<your_discourse_forum_url>` `/admin/site_settings/category/plugins?filter=plugin%3Adiscourse-unikname-connect-authentication-plugin`

Then, configure the following attributes:

| Attribut | Description |
|--------|-----------|
| `Unikname-Connect enabled`  | Of course, check this box to enable Unikname Connect login for your users |
| `Unikname-Connect Account ID` | The Unikname-Connect Account ID you have received from Unikname's support request |
| `Unikname-Connect API secret key` | The API secret key you have received from Unikname's support request |
| `UniknameConnect authorize scope` | `openid` by default |

## Step 3. Test Unikname Connect on your Discourse Forum

## FAQ

### How to configure the verification key in your Discourse?

The verification of your domain requires to expose the verification key to the crawling of a web bot (such as a search engine bot, but dedicated to Unikname ecosystem).
The best way to do that, is to add a `meta` HTML tag in the main page of your Discourse web site.

We advise you to follow this [Discourse guide on Meta](https://meta.discourse.org/t/how-to-perform-google-search-console-a-k-a-google-webmaster-tools-verification-with-discourse/107229), where you must replace the meta tag by yours:

```
<meta name="uns-url-checker-verification" content="your_verification_Key">
```

## Troubleshooting

If youâ€™re having issues when connecting (access denied ...), check that the credentials (the @unikname of your organization, Unikname Connect secret, client id/secret ...) you are using to connect to <brand name="UNC"/> authentication server are the good one.
