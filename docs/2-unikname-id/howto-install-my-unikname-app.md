# How to install My Unikname App?

Unikname offers a decentralized robust authentication solution that is very easy to use, and ABOVE all fully respects users’ privacy. Its use is based on an application available on smartphones or tablets: we name it **My Unikname App**. 

**My Unikname App** allows @unikname owners to control their digital life. They can get and manage their @unikname SSID giving them total control over everything they can do with their ID, like private sign-up, login to websites, or validating operations such as paiements.

:::tip Under the hood
**My Unikname App** works like a cryptographic wallet. It embeds security features like handling pass phrase, handling private keys and calculating public addresses. So it is a safe place to manage your @unikname but also to manage your UNS tokens and to trigger transactions requiring tokens.
:::

But don’t try to download this application on traditional application stores (App Store for iOS, Google Play for Android); you won’t find it! **My Unikname App is a Progressive Web App (PWA)**, goodbye download, and welcome simplicity of installation thanks to the QR Code or a clickable link (your choice).
