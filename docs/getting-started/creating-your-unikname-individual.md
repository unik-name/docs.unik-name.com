### Creating a short @unikname, with a coupon 
If you have a coupon, you can create a "short" @unikname, of 8-characters, or more. 
Short @uniknames are protected by our Safetypo algorithm. It prevents other users to create identical or fraudulent @uniknames.

### Creating a free @unikname
You can create a @unikname for free, but it will be longer than 15 characters. 
Your @unikname is permanent and personal. 
If you wish to create a shorter @unikname, contact us on [contact@unikname.com](mailto:contact@unikname.com).
