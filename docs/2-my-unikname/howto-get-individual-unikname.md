This guide explains how to configure **My Unikname App**, on your smartphone or tablet, in order to acquire a personal @unikname identifier, for your personal use.

## 1. Define a PIN code
Before creating a @unikname identifier, you have to define a PIN code. This PIN code secures the access to the application on your smartphone. 

You'll be required to enter this PIN code everytime you launch **My Unikname App**.

### Creating a short @unikname identifier, with a coupon 
If you have a coupon, you can create a "short" @unikname identifier, of 8-characters, or more. 

Short @unikname identifiers are protected by our Safetypo algorithm. It prevents other users to create identical or fraudulent @uniknames.

### Creating a free @unikname identifier
You can create a @unikname identifier for free, only if it is longer than 15 characters. 

If you wish to create a shorter @unikname identifier, contact us on [contact@unikname.com](mailto:contact@unikname.com)

## 3. Backup your recovery key
Your @unikname identifier and all associated data (PIN code, recovery key) are strictly personal and confidential. We can't help you retrieve or restore it if you lose them or change your device. This is why **you must backup your recovery key immediately**.

Your recovery key is composed of 12 secret words.

1. Tap **Secure now**.
2. Keep pressing **Show recovery key** and write down your recovery key in a safe place.
