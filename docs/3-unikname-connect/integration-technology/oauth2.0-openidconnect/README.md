## Unikname Connect OAuth 2.0 / OIDC OpenID Connect features

The current implementation of Unikname Connect provides support for [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) and [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) protocols:

- OAuth 2.0 Grant Types:
  - [Authorization Code Grant](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/)
  - [Refresh token](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/refresh-token/)
  - [PKCE / Proof Key for Code Exchange](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/), which allows you not to use any secret key on your server
  - [Implicit Grant](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/implicit/)
- Standard OAuth 2.0 and OIDC OpenID Connect endpoints
- Access token and id token as signed and/or encrypted JWT

## OAuth 2.0 / OIDC OpenID Connect setup

Here are the informations you have to code or set up on your OAuth 2.0 service:

| Attribut | Value/Description |
|--------|-----------|
| OIDC discovery document | <UncServerUrl/> |
| OIDC client id | The Unikname-Connect Account ID you have received from Unikname's support request |
| OIDC client secret | The API secret key you have received from Unikname's support request |
| OIDC authorize scopes |`openid` by default. |

### Detailed OAuth 2.0 / OIDC OpenID Connect Endpoints

If the generic discovery document URL doesn't work for you, you can configure individual endpoints:

| Endpoint | URL |
|-|-|
| Authorize | `https://connect.unikname.com/oidc/authorize` |
| Token     | `https://connect.unikname.com/oidc/accessToken`    |
| Userinfo  | `https://connect.unikname.com/oidc/profile`    |
