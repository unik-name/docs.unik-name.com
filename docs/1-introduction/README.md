## Unikname Connect: The next-generation authentication solution

Unikname Connect is a very simple strong authentication and privacy-by-design login solution, rewarding users.

### Privacy-by-design

**User privacy comes first.** Unikname Connect is entirely built with the idea to keep user's connections private. Unikname does not collect any personal data (name, phone number, address, connection history...) at any time. The system will never use your @unikname identifier to trace your habits and behaviors on the Internet. 

Our technology makes it possible to customized user experience and services without collecting user data. Most of data are stored on user's smartphone and fully controlled by the user himself, and no one else. 

**Unikname Connect protects internet businesses from espionage**. User's connections are not traceable by third parties tracking tools. Only the user himself and the platform know their relationship.

### Unikname rewards its users

**Thanks to UNS Tokens,** Unikname users are encouraged to maximize use of their @unikname to log in any websites by rewarding them. Every unikname user who sign-up and login to a website receives rewards. These rewards are digital tokens called _UNS Tokens_. 

**Partner platforms using Unikname Connect offer promotional coupons for Unikname users.** UNS Tokens can be exchanged against vouchers or promotional coupons to be redeemed on any partner platforms.
