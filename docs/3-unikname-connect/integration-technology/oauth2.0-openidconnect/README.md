## Unikname Connect OAuth2.0 / OIDC features

The current implementation of Unikname Connect provides support for:

- Authorization Code Flow
- Implicit Flow
- Standard OAuth2.0 and OIDC endpoints

## OAuth2.0 / OIDC setup

Here are the informations you have to code or set up on your OAuth2.0 service:

| Attribut | Value/Description |
|--------|-----------|
| OIDC discovery document | <UncServerUrl/> |
| OIDC client id | The Unikname-Connect Account ID you have received from Unikname's support request |
| OIDC client secret | The API secret key you have received from Unikname's support request |
| OIDC authorize scopes |`openid` by default. |

### Detailed OAuth 2.0 / OIDC Endpoints

If the generic discovery document URL doesn't work for you, you can configure individual endpoints:

| Endpoint | URL |
|-|-|
| Authorize | `https://connect.unikname.com/oidc/authorize` |
| Token     | `https://connect.unikname.com/oidc/accessToken`    |
| Userinfo  | `https://connect.unikname.com/oidc/profile`    |

## Troubleshooting

If youâ€™re having issues when connecting (access denied ...), check that the credentials (the @unikname of your organization, Unikname Connect secret, client id/secret ...) you are using to connect to <brand name="UNC"/> authentication server are the good one.
