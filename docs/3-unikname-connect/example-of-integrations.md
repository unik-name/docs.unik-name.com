# Integration sandbox and examples

Quickly get a project started with any of our examples ranging from a typical standalone website sign-in to a fully integrated solution into a corporate system environment.

To play with these examples you need to use your own @unikname.

## Unikname only. Simply the simplest!

<brand name="UNC"/> can be used as the only way to authenticate.

In this example, **platform101.net** demo website has been coded and setup to sign-in with <brand name="unikname"/> only.

You receive a notification on your smartphone to get connected with your PIN code, for the sign-up but also for every later sign-in.

- [Run this example](https://www.platform101.net/)
- [Show me the code](https://github.com/unik-name/platform10x.net/blob/35498f0b9bea3f62426f6c2a4346629df4f8c27b/server.js)

## Unikname as an alternate to email/password

<brand name="UNC"/> can get along with traditional email/password authentication method.

In this example, **platform101.net** demo website has been coded and setup to sign-in with the traditional user email/password and also with <brand name="UNC"/>.

platform101.net is a basic HTML5 and CSS3 website.

## Unikname and Social Authentication

<brand name="UNC"/> can be used as a social authentication option.

In this example, **platform101.net** demo website has been coded and setup to sign-in with social authentication. The user can choose between Facebook, Google, Twitter and Unikname Connect.

## Unikname Automatic Connect

<brand name="UNC"/> can be used as the only way to authenticate but also as a very fast and automatic sign-in.

In this example, **platform102.net** demo website has been coded and setup to sign-in with Automatic Connect.

## Opensource framework Integration

<brand name="UNC"/> can be easily integrated within opensource frameworks compatible with the standard OAuth 2.0 protocol.

[Our discussion forum website](https://forum.unikname.com) is based on the famous open source Discourse solution. <brand name="unikname"/> users are automatically signed-in for an optimal user experience.

<brand name="UNC"/> can be used to access your Discourse accounts](/integration/connect/apps/discourse).
