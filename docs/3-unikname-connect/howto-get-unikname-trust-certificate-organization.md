# How to get and setup the @unikname Trust Certificate for your organization?

You've already discovered @unikname for individual where the main purpose is to allow people to keep full control of their Digital Identity and to keep their web authentications fully private. 

There's another type of @unikname dedicated for organization. These kind of @unikname are disclosed publicly and they're used by the <brand name="UNC"/> authentication protocole. Combined with the domain name of your website it offers a strong cyber-protection for your user account. @unikname for organization can only be obtained after human verification and from the Command Line Interface tool.

Here we're going to explain how to create a @unikname of type Organization, how to disclose it, and how to link it with with your website domain name to make it your trust certificate.

[[TOC]]

:::warning Prerequisite
:heavy_check_mark: You've already installed the Commande Line Interface on your desktop.  
<hbox>_See [How to install the CLI?](./howto-install-uns-cli)_</hbox>
:heavy_check_mark: Unikname Team has provided you an exclusive COUPON CODE
<hbox>_See [How to sign-up for a business account?](./howto-signup-business-account)_</hbox>

<hseparator/>

## Step 1. Create a new crypto account for your organization

First you need to create a cryptoaccount with the CLI. This one will be the cryptoaccount of your organization. 

You should've already done it for your individual @unikname, so the process is the same.

:::tip What is a Crypto Account?
A crypto Account is a digital account maintained in a highly secure way by a decentralized network, a blockchain, in which all transactions between you and others are recorded. It is safer than a bank account. 
:::

Open your terminal on your desktop and enter the following command: 
```bash 
$ uns cryptoaccount:create
```
The information of your newly created cryptoaccount are displayed: address, publicKey, privateKey, passphrase. Here is an example of what you see on your screen:

```bash
Â» :warn: Backup your cryptoaccount information in a secure place.
{
  "address": "UTUaW62xycJWMhKASg9kjmqYJTuQ1wvmat",
  "publicKey": "038e48ab5a8c9f5fbee7582102a913b209d705d9edd66024ba77897b50d04f45db",
  "privateKey": "****************************************************************",
  "passphrase": "**** ****** ***** ****** ******** ***** ********* ******* ****** ***** **** ******",
  "network": "livenet"
}
```
> NOTA: In your case the stars are replaced by real values and the address and the publicKey are your own ones.

Then make an immediate backup of these information in a safe place. We're going to reuse it soon.

## Step 2. Use your exclusive COUPON CODE to create the @unikname ID for your organization

Okay, now you can create the @unikname for your organization, using your exclusive COUPON CODE (see prerequisites here above) and with the information of the just created cryptoaccount.

The @unikname for your organization must contain at least one letter and be longer than 6 characters. We suggest to choose one very close to your domain name but without the `.com` or without any other extension.

Your @unikname is case, accent and hseparator insensitive like individual ones. That means that if you choose `my-saas-platform-101` then it's the same as `mySaaS_platform101` or `mysaasplatform*101`

:::warning
Choose your organization @unikname identifier wisely. Keep in mind that once created, this @unikname identifier will be permanently associated to your business and disclosed to the other users. 
:::

Enter the following command replacing `my-saas-platform-101` by your own identifier, and replacing `MY-EXCLUSIVE-COUPON` by the one you've obtained when you sign up.

```bash
$ uns unik:create --type=organization --explicitValue="my-saas-platform-101" --coupon="MY-EXCLUSIVE-COUPON"
```

The CLI ask you for your passphrase. Then enter the passphrase of the cryptoaccount you've just created here above.

The outcome looks like this:
```bash
{
  "data": {
    "id": "2e5ae117eaf17b113ab5f01defc851730bbddbb5d9d3c00c462778be62a9134e",
    "transaction": "f9718b85d6f88306e9eb3af4aa686897b8443e19251684976a6874c7f06a8378",
    "confirmations": 1
  }
}
```
> NOTA: The `id` is unique technical ID of the @unikname created and recorder.

You @unikname is obfuscated within the blockchain so that means **nobody knows it unless you**. It's very important you remember the @unikname you've chosen! Nobody can help you to look for it nor to recover it. 

:::tip Information
The strength of the cyber protection provided by Unikname Connect is based on the fact that you're the only one to own and control your @unikname and its digital keys. 
:::

Ok, now it's a good time to backup all these highly sensitive informations in a safe place: 

- The cryptoaccount of your company: `address`, `publicKey`, `privateKey`, `passphrase``
- The @unikname you've chosen, mentioning it's type: "organization", and its `id``
- Take care of spelling the 12 words of the passphrase. You should be able to access it for all your life long.

If you use a password safe solution like _lastpass_ or _keepass_ you're encouraged to save your information on it

:::danger
It is very important to save your cryptoaccount information at this stage! **There's no way to recover it** nor to look for it later. **So do it right now!**
:::

## Step 3. Disclose the @unikname of your organization

Unikname of type Organization must be publicly disclosed in order to be used with <brand name="UNC"/> on your website. By default all @unikname values are obfuscated and publicly hidden. 

Run the following command to disclose the @unikname of your organization:

```bash
$ uns unik:disclose "@organization:my-saas-platform-101" -e "my-saas-platform-101"
```

> Replace `my-saas-platform-101` by the @unikname of type organization you want to disclose. You need to change it at both places. For more informations about the Disclose command, see the [uns.network documentation](https://docs.uns.network/uns-use-the-network/cli.html#unik-disclose).

## Step 4. Prove the ownership of your website and link it to the @unikname of your Organization

Unikname of type Organization must be linked with your web domain name in order to be used with <brand name="UNC"/> on your website.
In concrete terms, this consists of generating a `Verification Key` from your @unikname and to publish it to your website.

This publication can be done in two ways depending on your credentials: either by modifying the `<head>` section of your html page, either by publishing a hidden text page directly at the URL of your website.

First of all enter the following command to generate the verification package, using the [`properties:register` CLI command](https://docs.uns.network/uns-use-the-network/cli.html#properties-register):

```bash
$ uns properties:register "@organization:my-saas-platform-101" --value "www.my-saas-platform-101.com" 
```
> Replace `my-saas-platform-101` by your @unikname of type Organization and `www.my-saas-platform-101.com` by the URL of your own website.

Do not include the `https://` protocol string in front of your domain name. It is added by default by the command.

The outcome will be like that:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "url",
    "value": "www.my-saas-platform-101.com",
    "filename": "uns-verification.txt",
    "verificationKey": "TOlzvZCLq3KufJOg7RjNE",
    "expirationDate": "2020-08-15T12:39:31.000Z"
  }
}
```
and will produce a file named `uns-verification.txt` in the current directory.

Then run the verification: 
* 1st way: Add An HTML <meta> tag to your website
* 2nd way: Upload a text file to your website

### 1st way: Add an HTML <meta> tag to your website

Add a `<meta...>` tag to the HTML code of the home page of your website, located at `https://www.my-saas-platform-101.com`. 

In the `<head>` section, like this:
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
    ...
    <!-- this is the line to add bellow -->
    <meta name="uns-url-checker-verification" content="your_verification_Key">
    ...
  </head>
<body>
...
```
> Replace `your_verification_Key` with the one that has been previously generated with the `uns properties:register` command.

Until done, finish the process by executing the [`properties:verify` CLI command](https://docs.uns.network/uns-use-the-network/cli.html#properties-verify):

```bash
$ uns properties:verify "@organization:www.my-saas-platform-101.com" --url-channel html
```

A uns.network **URL_Checker** service provider will crawl your website, within 72 hours, to check the verification package.

:::tip Information
Keep the HTML tag into the webpage as long as possible. An URL_Checker service may need up to 72 hours to check your website. Removing this HTML tag too soon from your site will cause the verification to fail.

It is also safe to leave it forever ðŸ˜‰
:::

::: details Potential errors

The following verification errors can occur with HTML tag verification:

- Meta tag not found/in the wrong location

  The verification meta tag must be within the `<head>` section of the page.
  If you see errors, check the following:

  - Is the meta tag on the correct page?

      The URL Checker looks for it on the site's home page.
      This is the page that the web server returns when someone requests the site (such as `http://www.mycompany.com/`).
      This page is often named `index.html` or `index.htm`, but could be named differently, depending on your server's configuration.
  
  - Is the meta tag in the correct place on the page?

    The URL Checker looks for it in the page's `<head>` section. An example of correct placement is shown here:

    ```html
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Page title</title>
        ...
        <meta name="uns-url-checker-verification" content="verificationKey">
        ...
      </head>
    <body>
    ...
    ```

    If you're using a web editor or a WYSIWYG editor to edit your page, make sure to select the 'Edit HTML' option or to edit the source code of the page.

- The meta tag is incorrect

  The URL Checker found the verification meta tag, but the content was incorrect.
  To avoid errors, copy and paste the `verificationKey` value provided by the [`properties:register`](#properties-register) command.

- More [common verification problems](#common-verification-errors) are listed below.

:::

### 2nd way: Upload a text file to your website

Upload the `uns-verification.txt` file that has been previously generated with the `uns properties:register` command to the subdirectory `.well-known` of the root folder of your website.

The **URL_Checker** service will verify the file by reaching the following URL: `https://www.my-saas-platform-101.com/.well-known/uns-verification.txt`.

Until done, finish the process by executing the [`properties:verify` CLI command](https://docs.uns.network/uns-use-the-network/cli.html#properties-verify):

```bash
$ uns properties:verify "@organization:my-saas-platform-101.com" --url-channel file
```

A uns.network **URL_Checker** service provider will crawl your website, within 72 hours, to check the verification package.

:::tip Information
Keep the HTML tag into the webpage as long as possible. An URL_Checker service may need up to 72 hours to check your website. Removing this HTML tag too soon from your site will cause the verification to fail.

It is also safe to leave it forever ðŸ˜‰
:::

::: details Potential errors

The following verification errors can occur with uploading a text file verification:

- Verification file not found

  Please check where the `uns-verification.txt` file was uploaded.
  It must be reached at `https://www.my-saas-platform-101.com/.well-known/uns-verification.txt` location without any modifications.
  If the file name or content does not match the `uns-verification.txt` file provided, the uns.network **URL_Checker** service provider won't be able to verify your site ownership.

- Your verification file has the wrong content

  The uns.network **URL_Checker** service provider checks to see if your verification file has the same filename and content as the file provided by the CLI command.
  If the file name or content does not match the `uns-verification.txt` file provided, the uns.network **URL_Checker** service provider won't be able to verify your site ownership.
  Please, upload the `uns-verification.txt` file provided to the specified location without any modifications.

- Hacked verification file

  Your verification attempt failed in a way that indicates that your site might have been hacked.
  [Learn more about detecting and fixing hacked sites](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/hacked/).

- Your verification file redirects to a disallowed location.

  The uns.network **URL_Checker** service provider will not follow redirects for verification files; if your site redirects all traffic to another site, we recommend using [meta tag verification](#_1st-way-add-an-html-tag-to-your-website).

- More [common verification problems](#common-verification-errors) are listed below.
:::

### Common verification errors

In addition to any method-specific verification errors, the following verification errors are possible in most verification methods:

::: details Common verification errors

- The verification package is expired

  The verification package expires after 72h, so you must [restart the ownership process of your URL](#step-4-prove-the-ownership-of-your-website-and-link-it-to-the-unikname-of-your-organization).

- The connection to your server timed out.
  
  The uns.network **URL_Checker** service provider was unable to verify your file because he received a server timeout.
  This could be because your server is down or is busy and responding slowly.
  Make sure that your server is responding and try again.

- The uns.network **URL_Checker** service provider encountered an error looking up your site's domain name.

  He tried to access your verification file, but was unable to access your domain due to a DNS error.
  This could be because your server is down, or there is an issue with the DNS routing to your domain.
  Make sure that your domain is resolving correctly and try again.

- The download request was redirected too many times.

  Check the URL for potential issues, such as an infinite loop.

- Your server returned an invalid response.

  This can happen if your site is requires password authentication, or if we cannot access it for other reasons.

- The uns.network **URL_Checker** service provider was unable to connect to your server.

  Make sure that your server is not down, and that your domain is resolving correctly, and try again.

- An internal error occurred.

  If this problem persists, open a thread on our [Unikname forum](https://kover.link/5CBGgD).

- Timeout.

  Either your site or the domain server stopped responding to our requests (depending on the verification method used).
  Confirm that your site is responding, and then try again.
  If this problem persists, open a thread on our [Unikname forum](https://kover.link/5CBGgD).

- Could not find your domain.

  The uns.network **URL_Checker** service provider tried to resolve the site URL that you gave us, but it is unknown to the DNS service.
  Check that you are providing the correct URL for your property.
  If this problem persists, open a thread on our [Unikname forum](https://kover.link/5CBGgD).

### Notes

#### Your website logo

While verifying your website URL, the uns.network **URL_Checker** service provider will try to crawl and store your website main logo to display it to your users when they connect with Unikname Connect.

#### About the User-Agent

The user agent of the uns.network **URL_Checker** service provider that performs HTML tag or file verification has the user agent token `UNS-URL-Checker-Verification` and the full user agent string is `Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; UNS-URL-Checker-Verification/1.0; <DID>)` where `DID` is the ID of the URL_Checker service provider that performs the verification (such as [`did:unik:unid:fbfbe7d9e8c005f1a9937d9fd17c4ef7da2ff8037a71e6cb7847b302eda4d08a`](https://explorer.uns.network/uniks/08bf335ede1818e222ecd529e0e892190aab62a39ec40492395b825a4f640731) for one of the official URL_Checkers service providers).

## Step 5. Check your setup in the uns.network blockchain explorer

In the <brand name="uns"/> blockchain explorer you can find all the information related to any @unikname Identifier.

To check that your organization @unikname identifier has been created correctly:

Open the [UNS Network explorer](https://explorer.uns.network/) and enter `@organization:my-saas-platform-101.com` in the search.

<hpicture>![explorer-search-@organization_mycompany](./images/chechunexplorer.png)</hpicture>

> Replace `my-saas-platform-101.com` with your own organization @unikname identifier.

Then check the information associated with your organization @unikname identifier:

:heavy_check_mark: Your unikname is disclosed. You can read it on the explorer.   
:heavy_check_mark: Your unikname is of type Organization   
:heavy_check_mark: Your unikname contains your verified URL. (You need to scroll down the properties to see it)  
:heavy_check_mark: Your unikname address is the right one.  

**All done!** 

<hseparator/>

---

What you've achieved here:

:heavy_check_mark: Created an @unikname of type `organization`  
:heavy_check_mark: Disclosed your @unikname  
:heavy_check_mark: Linked your @unikname with the domain name of your website
