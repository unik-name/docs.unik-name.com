## Unikname Connect Uses Cases

Quickly get a project started with any of our examples ranging from a typical standalone website sign-in to a fully integrated solution into a corporate system environment.

To play with these examples you need to use your own @unikname.

### Unikname only. Simply the simplest!

<Uniknameconnect/> can be used as the only way to authenticate.

In this example, **platform101.net** demo website has been coded and setup to sign-in with <brand name="unikname"/> only.

You receive a notification on your smartphone to get connected with your PIN code, for the sign-up but also for every later sign-in.

### Unikname as an alternate to email/password

<uniknameconnect/> can get along with traditional email/password authentication method.
