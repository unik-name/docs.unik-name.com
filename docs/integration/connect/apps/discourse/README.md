## About Discourse

![Discourse](./discourse-logo-full.png)

<uniknameconnect/> can be easily integrated within opensource frameworks compatible with the standard OAuth authorization protocol.

In this example, [our discussion forum website](https://forum.unikname.com/) is based on the famous open source [Discourse forum solution](https://www.discourse.org).
<unikname/> users are automatically signed in for an optimal user experience.

ðŸ‘‰ [Run this example](https://forum.unikname.com/)

## Discourse plugin installation

- Connect to your Discourse server (sorry, you can't install a plugin from the admin panel ðŸ˜ž)
- Access your containerâ€™s `app.yml` file (it should be present in `/var/discourse/containers/`)

    cd /var/discourse
    nano containers/app.yml

Add the Discourse Unikname Connect pluginâ€™s repository URL to your containerâ€™s `app.yml` file:

```
hooks:
  after_code:
    - exec:
        cd: $home/plugins
        cmd:
          - ...
          - sudo -E -u discourse git clone https://github.com/unik-name/discourse-unikname
```

(Add the pluginâ€™s `git clone` url just below `sudo -E -u discourse git clone https://github.com/discourse/docker_manager.git`)

Rebuild the container:

    cd /var/discourse
    ./launcher rebuild app

Thatâ€™s it, youâ€™ve successfully installed the Unikname Connect plugin on your Discourse instance!
