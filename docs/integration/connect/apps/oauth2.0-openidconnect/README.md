## Unikname Connect OAuth2.0 / OIDC features

The current implementation of Unikname Connect provides support for:

- Authorization Code Flow
- Implicit Flow
- Standard OAuth2.0 and OIDC endpoints

## OAuth2.0 / OIDC setup

Here are the informations you have to code or set up on your service:

| Attribut | Description |
|--------|-----------|
| OIDC discovery document | <UncServerUrl/> |
| OIDC client id | The client id you have received from Unikname's support request |
| OIDC client secret | The client secret you have received from Unikname's support request |
| OIDC authorize scopes |`openid` by default.<br/>You can request for more informations, such as `profile` or `email` (which may be verified or not) |

### Detailed OAuth 2.0 / OIDC Endpoints

If the generic discovery document URL doesn't work for you, you can configure individual endpoints:

|  Endpoint |                  URL                 |
|:---------:|:------------------------------------:|
| Authorize | `https://connect.unikname.com/oidc/authorize` |
| Token     | `https://connect.unikname.com/oidc/accessToken`    |
| Userinfo  | `https://connect.unikname.com/oidc/profile`    |
