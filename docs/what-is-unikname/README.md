# What is Unikname Connect?

Unikname Connect is a simple, secure and privacy-by-design login solution. 

A simple-login solution
Unikname Connect allows you to log in to websites simply with your @unikname. No password is required.

A secure solution
Based on a blochain technology, Unikname Connect is fully decentralized. It is a natural anti-spoofing solution because nobody except you knows your @unikname and can use it to login to websites. and security information (PIN code +  pass phrase). This means nobody except you can use your @unikname. 
It a natural anti-phishing solution as you don't create any password and as we don't store any of your personal data. There is no database to violate. 
Moreover, it is impossible to create two similar @uniknames. Unikname Connect uses an algorithm, called Safetypo, that prevents the creation of similar @uniknames.
Example :
once @cecile has been created, it is impossible to create @cecilee or @cec1le, and so on. 

in which a person or program successfully identifies as another by falsifying data, to gain an illegitimate advantage.

Privacy-by-design
Privacy comes first. Our application is enterely built with the idea to keep your personal data private. We don't collect these personal data (name, phone number, address, history) at any moment as well as we will never use your @unikname to trace your habits and behaviors on the Web.
