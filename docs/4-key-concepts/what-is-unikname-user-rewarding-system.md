# What is the Unikname User Rewarding System?

<p class="focustext">
Unikname rewards users who want to make internet a safer place thanks to the unikname.network blockchain and its UNIK token.
</p>

**Thanks to UNIK Tokens,** Unikname users are encouraged to maximize use of their @unikname to log in to any websites by rewarding them. 

Every unikname user who sign-up and login to a website accumulate claimable credits (1). These credits are digital tokens called _UNIK Tokens_. User claim his reward when he wants, and receives UNIK tokens (2). Partner ecommerce website (eg. woocommerce...) using <brand name="UNC"/> propose special offers to Unikname users holding UNIK tokens (3). During the payment process users can redeem some of their UNIK tokens  for a partner offer (4).
