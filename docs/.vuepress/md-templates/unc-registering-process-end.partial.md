## Testing the integration

Just go to your service web site and click `Connect with your private @unikname` or `Use your private @unikname`.

You should see the Unikname Login screen similar to this:

## Troubleshooting

If you’re having issues when connecting (access denied ...), first ensure the credentials (@unikname, Unikname Connect secret, client id/secret ...) you are using to connect to <uniknameconnect/> server are the good one.

Then, check that you’re using the latest version of all OpenID Connect SDK, library, plugin or service embedded in your application.

After that, if still you need help to integrate with Unikname Connect, you can get support on [the Unikname Forum](https://forum.unikname.com/c/support/15).
