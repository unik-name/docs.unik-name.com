You are now ready for the next step !

## 2. Creating and saving your cryptoaccount information

To create an organization @unikname, you need to create a cryptoaccount, first. 

1. Open the CLI.
2. Type the following command: `cryptoaccount:create`.
3. The information of your newly created cryptoaccount are displayed (address, publicKey, privateKey, passphrase).

Here is an example of what you are supposed to see on your command prompt:

```bash
uns cryptoaccount:create
» :warn: Save the information of your account in a safe.
{
  "address": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "publicKey": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "privateKey": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "passphrase": "XXXXX XXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXXX XXXX XXXXX",
  "network": "livenet"
}
```
4. Save these information in a secure place, in a backup file which you couldn’t forget. 

:::warn: If, for any reason, you lose your cryptoaccount information and your @unikname, this backup file will help you to recover your cryptoaccount. Note that we can't retrieve your cryptoaccount information for you!
:::

## 3. Using a COUPON to create the organization @unikname 

Creating an organization @unikname requires a COUPON.
If you already have one, skip to [3. Creating the organization unikname](##CreateOrgaUnikname) 

Otherwise, it's time [to get in contact with the Unikname team](https://www.unikname.com/get-started/) to discuss atbout your Unikname Connect integration, your specific needs... You will get a COUPON in return.

## 3. Creating the organization @unikname 

Once you have a coupon, all you have to do is to create the @unikname!

:::warning For security and confidentiality reasons, neither <uns/> nor Unikname can retrieve your @unikname for you, in the event you lose it. That is why **you must save the passphrase, associated to your @unikname**.:::

:::warning Choosing the @unikname
Choose your organization @unikname wisely.
Keep in mind that once created, this @unikname will be permanently associated to your business and disclosed to the other users. You can't change your organization @unikname at any time. :::

1. **Back up the passphrase in a secure file**. 
2. Use the [`unik:create`](https://docs.uns.network/uns-use-the-network/cli.html#unik-create) command, in <uns/> CLI to create your organization @unikname.
3. In CLI, copy and paste the following piece of code, to create your organization @unikname: 
```bash
$ uns unik:create --explicitValue "mycompany" --type organization --coupon "HERE_THE_COUPON"
```
4. Replace the value `mycompany` by your organization @unikname.
5. Replace the value `HERE_THE_COUPON` with the coupon you received.
6. Enter your passphrase, when asked.
7. "data", "transaction" and "confirmations" lines should be displayed.

```bash
$ uns unik:create --explicitValue "mycompany" --type organization --coupon "HERE_THE_COUPON"
Enter your crypto account passphrase (12 words phrase): ***************************
{
  "data": {
    "id": "ccabe13311350a306d510c3484889a151eda9a1b61b5fe4d346fd3b1eeb42c25",
    "transaction": "4bcde02ec632bd5531aa8710b0a13f469a59caec910dc610d46f6b8ebdcaf9ac",
    "confirmations": 1
  }
}
```

## 4. Checking the creation of the organization @unikname in the uns.network explorer

In the uns.network explorer, you can find all the information associated to any @unikname.

1. Launch the [UNS Network explorer](https://explorer.uns.network/) by clicking this link.
2. In the search bar, type **@organization:mycompany**
3. Replace **mycompany** by the @unikname you are looking for. 


![explorer-search-@organization_mycompany](./images/explorer-search-@organization_mycompany.png)

You will now configure the @unikname.
