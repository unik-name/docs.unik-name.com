# How much does it cost to get a PREMIUM @unikname ID?

All @unikname IDs shorter than 15 characters are PREMIUM ones and have to be paid. 

The shorter a name, the rarer it is, the more expensive it is. There will be one and only one <un id="@bob"/>. :-)

- PREMIUM ID can have a public registry with up to 100 properties. 
- PREMIUM ID receive a welcome reward of 100 UNS tokens at activation time.
