# What is 'my unikname App'?

**My Unikname App works like a cryptographic wallet.** It embeds security features like handling pass phrase, handling private keys and calculating public addresses. It is a safe place to manage your @unikname IDs and to manage your UNS tokens. It is also the only one app that allow authentications (sign-up, login, document authentication...) with your self-sovereign ID.

**My Unikname App is a Progressive Web App (PWA).** Don’t try to download this application on traditional App stores, you won’t find it! goodbye download and welcome simplicity of installation thanks to a QR Code or a clickable link.
