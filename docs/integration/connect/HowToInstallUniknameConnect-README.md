Subscribing to the Unikname newsletter
------------------------------------------
As a decentralized application, we will never link the e-mail address you enter to subscribe to the newsletter to your Unikname identifier. 


We store your e-mail address on a specific Unikname server. We use this server only to store our customers e-mail addresses. 
Different from a Saas (Software as a Service)...
Important - do we really need to specify that? 

What is your newsletter client? Mailtrain
Why do you use Mailtrain? We use mail train because it is a self-hosted app. We store it on our own secured and private server.

Defining your PIN Code

This pin code will be required/asked, on your smartphone, every time you want to login, via Unikname Connect, to a website.

Getting a Unikname for free: more than 15 characters
Getting a shorter unikname : requires payment 
Why do I have to pay for a Unikname shorter than 15 characters? It is more rare and "for life".

Self-sovereign identity principle: (wikipedia) With self-sovereign identity the individual identity holders can fully create and control their 
credentials, without being forced to request permission of an intermediary or centralised authority and gives control over how their personal 
data is shared and used. 
Is not stored in any database. 

See if mentioning the out-of-band and in-band controls are worth mentioning or not, for the users. Technical data only, maybe?
