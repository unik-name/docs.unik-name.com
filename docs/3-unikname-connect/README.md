# Getting started with Unikname Connect

Integrating Unikname Connect onto your website is quite simple:

[[TOC]]

Then the Unikname Connect button is immediately available onto your website and users can start to sign-up, to login, and to receive rewards!

And if you've joined the APOLLO Partnership program you will see incoming traffic as soon as the partnership tag is taken into account on your website.

For the integration itself (step 3) the process depends on your website. There's 5 ways to make the integration:

- **NodeJS SDK** &rightarrow; your website has been developed with **NodeJS programing langage**, few lines of code need to be added.
- **OAuth2.0 and OpendID Connect APIs** &rightarrow; for any website you can **call our APIs**.
- **Simple setup of Auth0** &rightarrow; your website already embed **Auth0 Authentication services**, e.g. Social Authent 
- **Unikname Connect Wordpress plugin** &rightarrow; you want to install to a **Wordpress website** or a **WooCommerce website**  
- **Unikname Connect Discourse plugin** &rightarrow; you want to install to a **Discourse Forum** 

:::tip 
:hourglass: Usually it takes between 30 minutes and 4 hours to follow the end to end integration process. The time depends on your website technology.
