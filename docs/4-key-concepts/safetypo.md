What is Safetypo?
------------------------------------------
The @unikname identifiers are based on the SafeTypo© technology. 
The SafeTypo© technology buildS trustworthy Human-Readable identifiers that cannot be counterfeit.
They're easily readable, spellable and communicable safely regarding spoofing, typosquatting risks and phishing hacks.

Why?
The SafeTypo© technology prevents users from creating similar and confusing identifiers.
No errors due to confusing characters, accents, homonyms, separators or not, character inversion, international charset…

Nobody can create a @unikname identifier that closely resemble your own or with misstyped variations to trick you when you login on a website.

**Example:**
Your @unikname is @cecile.
Safetypo technology prevents other users to create a @unikname similar to yours, with:
- upper-case (@Cecile), 
- with accents (@cécile)
- with other characters (@cec-ile, @c&ecile).

However, other users are free to create @cecilee, @cec1le, and so on.

If you can't create a @unikname identifier refer to our Safetypo Alphabet.
