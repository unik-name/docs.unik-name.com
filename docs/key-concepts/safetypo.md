What is Safetypo?
------------------------------------------
the @unikname identifiers are based on the SafeTypo© technology. 
The SafeTypo© technology buildS trustworthy Human-Readable identifiers that cannot be counterfeit.
They're easily readable, spellable and communicable safely regarding spoofing, typosquatting risks and phishing hacks.

Why?
The SafeTypo© technology prevents users from creating similar and confusing identifiers.
No errors due to confusing characters, accents, homonyms, separators or not, character inversion, international charset…


**Example**
If you create @cecilia as a @unikname, nobody can create something similar:
- cecilee
- no confusing characters or characters inversion: cec1le, cicele
- no accent: cécile
- case-insensitive: Cecile
- ceci-lia
