# How to get and setup the @unikname Trust Certificate for your organization?

You've already discovered @unikname for individual where the main purpose is to allow people to keep full control of their Digital Identity and to keep their web authentications fully private. 

There's another type of @unikname dedicated for organization. These kind of @unikname are disclosed publicly and they're used by the <brand name="UNC"/> authentication protocole. Combined with the domain name of your website it offers a strong cyber-protection for your user account. @unikname for organization can only be obtained after human verification and from the Command Line Interface tool.

Here we're going to explain how to create a @unikname of type Organization, how to disclose it, and how to link it with with your website domain name to make it your trust certificate.

:::warning Prerequisite
:heavy_check_mark: You've already installed the Commande Line Interface on your desktop.  
<hbox>_See [How to install the CLI?](./howto-install-uns-cli)_</hbox>
:heavy_check_mark: Unikname Team has provided you an exclusive COUPON CODE

## Step 1. Create a new crypto account for your organization

First you need to create a cryptoaccount with the CLI. This one will be the cryptoaccount of your organization. 

You should've already done it for your individual @unikname, so the process is the same.

:::tip What is a Crypto Account?
A crypto Account is a digital account maintained in a highly secure way by a decentralized network, a blockchain, in which all transactions between you and others are recorded. It is safer than a bank account. 
:::

Open your terminal on your desktop and enter the following command: 
```bash 
$ uns cryptoaccount:create
```
The information of your newly created cryptoaccount are displayed: address, publicKey, privateKey, passphrase. Here is an example of what you see on your screen:

```bash
Â» :warn: Backup your cryptoaccount information in a secure place.
{
  "address": "UTUaW62xycJWMhKASg9kjmqYJTuQ1wvmat",
  "publicKey": "038e48ab5a8c9f5fbee7582102a913b209d705d9edd66024ba77897b50d04f45db",
  "privateKey": "****************************************************************",
  "passphrase": "**** ****** ***** ****** ******** ***** ********* ******* ****** ***** **** ******",
  "network": "livenet"
}
```
> NOTA: In your case the stars are replaced by real values and the address and the publicKey are your own ones.

Then make an immediate backup of these information in a safe place. We're going to reuse it soon.

## Step 2. Use your exclusive COUPON CODE to create the @unikname ID for your organization

Okay, now you can create the @unikname for your organization, using your exclusive COUPON CODE (see prerequisites here above) and with the information of the just created cryptoaccount.

The @unikname for your organization must contain at least one letter and be longer than 6 characters. We suggest to choose one very close to your domain name but without the `.com` or without any other extension.

Your @unikname is case, accent and hseparator insensitive like individual ones. That means that if you choose `my-saas-platform-101` then it's the same as `mySaaS_platform101` or `mysaasplatform*101`

:::warning
Choose your organization @unikname identifier wisely. Keep in mind that once created, this @unikname identifier will be permanently associated to your business and disclosed to the other users. 
:::

Enter the following command replacing ``my-saas-platform-101`` by your own identifier, and replacing `MY-EXCLUSIVE-COUPON` by the one you've obtained when you sign up.

```bash
$ uns unik:create --type=organization --explicitValue="my-saas-platform-101" --coupon="MY-EXCLUSIVE-COUPON"
```

The CLI ask you for your passphrase. Then enter the passphrase of the cryptoaccount you've just created here above.

The outcome looks like this:
```bash
{
  "data": {
    "id": "2e5ae117eaf17b113ab5f01defc851730bbddbb5d9d3c00c462778be62a9134e",
    "transaction": "f9718b85d6f88306e9eb3af4aa686897b8443e19251684976a6874c7f06a8378",
    "confirmations": 1
  }
}
```
> NOTA: The `id` is unique technical ID of the @unikname created and recorder.

You @unikname is obfuscated within the blockchain so that means **nobody knows it unless you**. It's very important you remember the @unikname you've chosen! Nobody can help you to look for it nor to recover it. 

:::tip Information
The strength of the cyber protection provided by Unikname Connect is based on the fact that you're the only one to own and control your @unikname and its digital keys. 
:::

Ok, now it's a good time to backup all these highly sensitive informations in a safe place: 

- The cryptoaccount of your company: ``address``, ``publicKey``, ``privateKey``, ``passphrase``
- The @unikname you've chosen, mentioning it's type: "organization", and its ``id``
- Take care of spelling the 12 words of the passphrase. You should be able to access it for all your life long.

If you use a password safe solution like _lastpass_ or _keepass_ you're encouraged to save your information on it

:::danger
It is very important to save your cryptoaccount information at this stage! **There's no way to recover it** nor to look for it later. **So do it right now!**
:::

## Step 3. Disclose the @unikname of your organization

Unikname of type Organization must be publicly disclosed in order to be used with <brand name="UNC"/> on your website. By default all @unikname values are obfuscated and publicly hidden. 

Run the following command to disclose the @unikname of your organization:

```bash
$ uns unik:disclose "@organization:my-saas-platform-101" -e "my-saas-platform-101"
```

> Replace `my-saas-platform-101` by the @unikname of type organization you want to disclose. You need to change it at both places. For more informations about the Disclose command, see the [uns.network documentation](https://docs.uns.network/uns-use-the-network/cli.html#unik-disclose).

## Step 4. Prove the ownership of your website and link it to the @unikname of your Organization

Unikname of type Organization must be linked with your web domain name in order to be used with <brand name="UNC"/> on your website. In concrete terms, this consists of generating a ``Verification Key`` from your @unikname and to publish it to your website. This publication can be done in two ways depending on your credentials: either by modifying the `<head>` section of your html page, either by publishing a hidden text page directly at the URL of your website.

First of all enter the following command to generate the verification package:
```bash
$ uns properties:register "@organization:my-saas-platform-101" --value "www.my-saas-platform-101.com" 
```
> Replace `my-saas-platform-101` by your @unikname of type Organization and `www.my-saas-platform-101.com` by the URL of your own website.

Do not include the `https://` protocol string in front of your domain name. It is added by default by the command.

The outcome will be like that:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "url",
    "value": "www.my-saas-platform-101.com",
    "filename": "uns-verification.txt",
    "verificationKey": "TOlzvZCLq3KufJOg7RjNE",
    "expirationDate": "2020-08-15T12:39:31.000Z"
  }
}
```
and will produce a file named `uns-verification.txt` in the current directory.

Then run the verification: 
* 1st way: Add An HTML <meta> tag to your website
* 2nd way: Upload a text file to your website

### 1st way: Add An HTML <meta> tag to your website

Add a `<meta...>` tag to the HTML code of the home page of your website, located at `https://www.my-saas-platform-101.com`. 

In the `<head>` section, like this:
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
    ...
    <!-- this is the line to add bellow -->
    <meta name="uns-url-checker-verification" content="your_verification_Key">
    ...
  </head>
<body>
...
```
> Replace `your_verification_Key` with the one that has been previously generated with the `uns properties:register` command.

Until done, finish the process by executing the following command:

```bash
$ uns properties:verify "@organization:www.my-saas-platform-101.com" --url-channel html
```

A uns.network **URL_Checker** service provider will crawl your website, within 72 hours, to check the verification package.

:::tip Information
Keep the HTML tag into the webpage as long as possible. An URL_Checker service may need up to 72 hours to check your website. Removing this HTML tag too soon from your site will cause the verification to fail.

It is also safe to leave it forever ðŸ˜‰
:::
 
### 2nd way: Upload a text file to your website

Upload the `uns-verification.txt` file that has been previously generated with the `uns properties:register` command to the subdirectory `.well-known` of the root folder of your website.

The **URL_Checker** service will verify the file by reaching the following URL: `https://www.my-saas-platform-101.com/.well-known/uns-verification.txt`

Last, enter the following command to finish the verification process:

```bash
$ uns properties:verify "@organization:my-saas-platform-101.com" --url-channel file
```

A uns.network **URL_Checker** service provider will crawl your website, within 72 hours, to check the verification package.

:::tip Information
Keep the HTML tag into the webpage as long as possible. An URL_Checker service may need up to 72 hours to check your website. Removing this HTML tag too soon from your site will cause the verification to fail.

It is also safe to leave it forever ðŸ˜‰
:::

## Step 5. Check your setup in the uns.network blockchain explorer

In the <brand name="uns"/> blockchain explorer you can find all the information related to any @unikname Identifier.

To check that your organization @unikname identifier has been created correctly:

Open the [UNS Network explorer](https://explorer.uns.network/) and enter ``@organization:my-saas-platform-101.com`` in the search.

<hpicture>![explorer-search-@organization_mycompany](./images/chechunexplorer.png)</hpicture>

> Replace ``my-saas-platform-101.com`` with your own organization @unikname identifier.

Then check the information associated with your organization @unikname identifier:

:heavy_check_mark: Your unikname is disclosed. You can read it on the explorer.   
:heavy_check_mark: Your unikname is of type Organization   
:heavy_check_mark: Your unikname contains your verified URL. (You need to scroll down the properties to see it)  
:heavy_check_mark: Your unikname address is the right one.  

**All done!**

What you've achieved here:

:heavy_check_mark: Created an @unikname of type `organization`  
:heavy_check_mark: Disclosed your @unikname  
:heavy_check_mark: Linked your @unikname with the domain name of your website
